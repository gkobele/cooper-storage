This repository contains the [**Coq**](https://coq.inria.fr/) code (in the file `ParameterizedApplicativeFunctors.v`) associated with the paper [*The Cooper Storage Idiom*](http://home.uchicago.edu/~gkobele/files/Kobele16CooperStorageIdiom.pdf).

In particular, *parameterized applicative functors* are defined, and proven to be closed under composition, as per the appendix to the paper.
